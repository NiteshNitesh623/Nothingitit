Good , i can edit this file from inside my codebase ...
and i don't see anything wrong with it ...

### why i created this repo
- for learning how to push code on github
- this task was not easy, i littrellly spend 3 days to learn simple pusing it on github,
- sometimes ssh keys are not properly copied
- sometimes personal access token create essue
- but finally this happened . and i am happy ( but i forgot how i done this , i need a little revision )
